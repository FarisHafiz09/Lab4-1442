<p> 
Jabal an-Nouris a mountain near Mecca in the Hejazi region of Saudi Arabia.
 The mountain houses the grotto or cave of Hira which holds tremendous significance for Muslims throughout the world,
 as the Islamic prophet Muhammad is said to have spent time in this cave meditating,
 and it is widely believed that it was here that he received his first revelation,
 which consisted of the first five ayats of Surah Al-Alaq from the angel Jibra'il (as is pronounced in certain Quran recitation schools and some Arab tribes; also known as Gabriel).
 It is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Makkah.
 The mountain itself is barely 640 m (2,100 ft) tall; nonetheless one to two hours are needed to make the strenuous hike to the cave.
 There are 1750 steps to the top which, even for a fit individual, can take anywhere between half an hour and one-and-a-half hours.

Taking 1750 walking steps to reach, the cave itself is about 3.7 m (12 ft) in length and 1.60 m (5 ft 3 in) in width.
The cave is situated at a height of 270 m (890 ft).
During the season of Ḥajj ('Pilgrimage'),an estimated five thousand visitors climb to the cave daily to see the place where Muhammad is believed to have received the first revelation of the Quran on the Night of Power by the angel Jibreel.
The majority of Muslims do not consider visiting the cave as an integral part of the Hajj.
 Nonetheless many visit it for reasons of personal pleasure and spirituality, and though some consider it a place of worship, this view conflicts with Salafist interpretations of Islamic ritual.
 While the cave plays an important role in As-Sīrah an-Nabawiyyah (The Prophetic Biography), it is not considered as holy as other sites in Mecca, such as Al-Haram Mosque, and so under most interpretations of Islam, the same reward is received for praying here as any other place in Mecca.
 Before Muhammad's first revelation, he was said to have pleasant dreams. Among these dreams were signs that his Prophethood was starting to appear, and signs that the stones in Mecca would greet him with the Salaam. These dreams lasted for six months.
